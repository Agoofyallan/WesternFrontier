This is my first project created in CodeSandbox and uploaded to GitHub. I'm a high school student learning web development, and this sandbox represents some of my earliest steps.

## What I learned
- Basics of **HTML** structure  
- Styling pages using **CSS**  
- Adding interactivity with **JavaScript**  
- Using CodeSandbox and pushing a project to GitHub
